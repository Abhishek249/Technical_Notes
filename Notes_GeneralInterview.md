Interview prep takes time, and it pays off. The more you practice, the more confident you’ll be. 

Get started by exploring this list of tips for answering the most common interview topics and questions, gathered during my years as a recruiter. Write down your answers and hone and edit from there. Record yourself answering, and get someone to give you feedback on your delivery. 

1. “Tell me about yourself.”
Tip: Don’t start with your early years. Interviewers aren’t asking for an autobiography. Take this opportunity to validate their decision to see you. Highlight what sets you apart from other candidates by focusing on the things that make you exceptional.
Ans: My name is Abhishek Jain.
Academically: I am currently a Computer Science graduate student at Arizona State University,graduating in May 2019.

By Profession : I am Software Engineer with 2 years of experience in Full Stack software Development, Object Oriented Programming, RESTful web services , Source Control, Application Deployment and Agile Methodologies.

Behavior wise: I am a congenial personality who can get along with people really well. Besides that I like working in small teams which are self-specialized but at the same time are transparently communicative with cross-functional teams. 
I don’t mind my beliefs getting challenged but I do make sure that I don’t compromise when it comes to taking my stand for the right thing and right people.


2. “Tell me about your work or management style.” 
Tip: Come across as an effective leader, but without sounding too boastful. Describe what makes you a strong manager, and then reinforce how you embody those strengths. Give specific examples.
Currently I am working part-time as Full Stack Web and Data Engineer at EdPlus at ASU where we create innovative pathways to education at scale and speed for everyone, everywhere.
      My current project is about building chat application where online course professors and students can chat with each other. The tech stack for this project is Drupal Framework on the frontend and the Amazon Web services like API Gateway for RESTful services, Lambda Functions for Serverless architecture, DynamoDB for databases and Twilio api for delivering messages to students.

 Previously I have worked as Software Engineer at Tech Mahindra Ltd in India where our team developed a Change Order Request Engineering System for the U.S. client Applied Materials. My responsibility included full stack development with Kendo UI, AJAX, jQuery on Frontend, C# .Net on Server Side, Microsoft SQL Server and Entity Framework on Database side.
My key contributions in that project were:-
I reduced the module development time by upto 40% across the team as measured by weekly deployments by advising use of jQuery Components rather than .Net components. This led to quick experimentation and shallow learning curve.
I accomplished 50%faster database query times as measured by SQL Profiler by implementing query optimization techniques like reducing table joins, data indexing and stored procedures for improved modularity.
I also proactively led the software development during peak delivery times. Here I recognized the specialization areas of fellow colleagues and distributed module responsibility accordingly.

3. Questions for the interviewer:-
Behavioral
How has been your journey so far with <xyz> ?
What are you looking for in a prospective candidate?
How do you assess culture fit?

Technical
What kind of work are you doing in cloud area or cloud based services.
What are the current problems that you are trying to solve
How do you assess the right fit?

3. “Why do you want this job?” or “Why should we hire you?”

Tip: Demonstrate how your experience and abilities are an excellent match. Show how compatible your aspirations are with the company’s objectives. Do some research to prepare for this one. Company pages on LinkedIn are a great place to start.


 4. “Why did you leave your last job?” or “Why are you leaving your current job?”

Tip: If your reasons are negative, put yourself in a positive light. Answers like “I want to be able to fully use my skills, and I wasn’t able to do so at my previous job” or “This new position offers a chance to exercise skills my previous job didn’t” are great. They don’t make you sound disgruntled.
